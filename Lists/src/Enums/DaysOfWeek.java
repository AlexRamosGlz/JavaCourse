 *  Java describes the enum type as: A special data type that contains predefined constants. A constant is a variable whose value can't
 *  change, once it's value has been assigned.
 *
 *  So an enum is a little like an array, except it's elements are known, not changeable, and each element can be referred to by a constant
 *  name, instead of an index position.
